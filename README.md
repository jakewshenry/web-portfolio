## Description

This week's challenge involves building a comprehensive portfolio page that will evolve as I progress through the course. A well-crafted portfolio serves as a powerful tool to showcase my skills and talents, making me an attractive candidate for part-time or full-time positions.

## User Story

AS A front end web developer
I WANT a portfolio that demonstrates my skills
SO THAT I am an attractive candidate for relevant jobs

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
